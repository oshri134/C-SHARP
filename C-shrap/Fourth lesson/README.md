# OOP - Object Oriented Programming 

OOP gives each object two parts: properties, methods. 

> the main goal of OOP: to make programming closed to the real world. 

## why use OOP?
* OOP is faster to execute. 
* OOP provides a clear structure of the program. 
* OOP helps with "DRP" (don't repeat yourself). 

### class 
We use class to create a template that does not take place in memory. 
instance - is every object from that class that has properties and methods. 

### Terms - מונחים
* OOP - תכנות מונחה עצמים
* class - מחלקה
* instance - מופע
* constructor - בנאי
